# Double Click Non-Native Files

A simple Obsidian plugin that changes the behavior of clicking file formats that don't natively open in Obsidian's File Explorer.

- **Single-click**: Selects the file (like Alt+click).
- **Double-click**: Opens the file in the default application.

This prevents accidental launches of programs, mimicking the behavior of Windows File Explorer and other file managers.
